### Example site powered by node, leaflet, react, es6 and more cutting edge tech than I can list [HERE](https://cdflint.github.io/WiHD/#map)

###### Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
> Primarily node and npm are command line driven.
>
> On windows use cmd.exe on mac or linux use terminal.
>
> Once installed some helpful packages include:
>
> `express` and `nodemon`
>
> There are many more packages that can be found [HERE](https://www.npmjs.com/).
>
> A good introduction to node for beginners can be found [HERE](https://www.nodebeginner.org/).

###### Make an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/)
> a thorough tutorial on github [HERE](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

###### Text editor [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/) ... and many more `pick one that your comfortable using`
> not sure what to use? ask a geek...the one to your left.

###### Finally the topic of the day `Leaflet`
> Leaflet is a lightweight web mapping application that is the core of what you will learn to use with this Demo.
>
> On leaflet's site they have simple tutorials [HERE](http://leafletjs.com/examples.html), but many more things can be done with their extensive [API](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.2.0.html)
>
> Even the 400 pound gorilla of the GIS world `ESRI` has developed plugins for leaflet [HERE](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/)
>
> and can be installed with the npm package managing system also.

###### Basics
> What projection should I use?

###### Basemaps
> Leaflet can serve many tiled basemaps.
>
> A good resource for basemaps can be found [HERE](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).
>
> The leaflet-providers basemaps can serve most people but maybe you want to utilize a [Google basemap](http://bl.ocks.org/crofty/2197701).
>
> If you look hard enough you can find any basemap you could ever want.

###### Content
> While Leaflet and websites can serve alot of types of content.
>
> We will be working with `html`, `javascript`, `geojson` files.
>
> Though like any website knowledge of `css` and `DOM` can be a game changer.
